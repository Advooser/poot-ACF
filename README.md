# poot-ACF

Armored Combat Framework/ACF for gmod, but it's not the original. heard about some gay ass updates coming for the official thing concerning really boring balances. this is old ACF, with some extra super-gorilla guns.
designed for my server pootland, but i won't piss on you for using it on your own server or on singleplayer or whatever

i don't really know or care that much about what the exact state of official ACF bollocks is but here's this. might update it if we dick with the ammo or make a new custom gun or something.

for the sake of not being sued or just dicked over generally, ACF isn't my work, this is my abominate, more fun version. this contains scuffed, badly designed weapons from around the block, the rest is just whatever came from the original ACF github at whatever point.
